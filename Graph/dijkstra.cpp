/* Problem Description */

/*
    There are n cities and m flight connections between them. 
    Your task is to determine the length of the shortest route from Syrjälä to every city.
*/

/*

    Input:
    The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of cities and flight connections. 
    The cities are numbered 1,2,…,n, and city 1 is Syrjälä.

    After that, there are m lines describing the flight connections. 
    Each line has three integers a, b and c: a flight begins at city a, ends at city b, and its length is c. 
    Each flight is a one-way flight.

    You can assume that it is possible to travel from Syrjälä to all other cities.

    Output:
    Print n integers: the shortest route lengths from Syrjälä to cities 1,2,…,n.

    Constraints:
    1 ≤ n≤ 105 
    1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅105
    1 ≤ a,b ≤ n
    1 ≤ c ≤109

    Example test Case:

    Input:
    3 4
    1 2 6
    1 3 2
    3 2 3
    1 3 4

    Output:
    0 5 2

    Explanation:
    The shortest route from Syrjälä to city 1 is 0, which has length 0.
    The shortest route from Syrjälä to city 2 is 0→3→2, which has length 2+3=5.
    The shortest route from Syrjälä to city 3 is 0→3, which has length 2.
